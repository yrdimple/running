My Dear Friend,

Congratulations on your graduation from collage! I am gald to hear that you plan on starting your career in China, and I would like to offer several suggestions that may be conducive to your job seeking.

Firstly, I hope you have done your career planning by taking your education, strengths and interests into account, based on which you may set about collecting informations regarding your dream industries and companies. Secondly, a variety of talent recuitment websites, inculding thoes specially designed for foreigners in China, are viable options, as you can receive first-hand information and submit your job application online. Thirdly, do not forget to apply for a post-study work visa. Otherwise, you will not be allowed to work in China.

Hopefully my suggestions above are hopeful and wish you all the best!
