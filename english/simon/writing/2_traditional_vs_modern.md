# traditional vs modern

### 失去传统技艺

<blockquote>

Because of industrialization and global trade, many traditional have disappered. Global advertising encourage everyone to buy the same products.

Most products are now made in factories. Machinery has replaced skilled human labour. Goods are produced very quickly and in large numbers. Products are cheaper, which means that more people can buy them. Factory work is boring and leaves people feeling unfulfilled.

Clothes are mass produced in standard size. People wear similar clothes, rather than traditional costumes. Jeans and T-shirts are now worn throughout the world.

Historic buildings took skilled craftsmen years to build. Modern concrete, steel and glass buildings are built in only weeks or months.

There are fewer people who can create hand-made goods.

<blockquote>

Traditional customs are still important during weddings and religious festivals. People wear traditional costumes and eat special foods.

It is important to maintain our different cultural identities. We should celebrate festivals, teach traditional skills and protect historic places.
