# traditional vs modern

## 观点
### 失去传统技艺

<blockquote>

Because of industrialization and global trade, many traditional have disappered. Global advertising encourage everyone to buy the same products.

Most products are now made in factories. Machinery has replaced skilled human labour. Goods are produced very quickly and in large numbers. Products are cheaper, which means that more people can buy them. Factory work is boring and leaves people feeling unfulfilled.

Clothes are mass produced in standard size. People wear similar clothes, rather than traditional costumes. Jeans and T-shirts are now worn throughout the world.

Historic buildings took skilled craftsmen years to build. Modern concrete, steel and glass buildings are built in only weeks or months.

There are fewer people who can create hand-made goods.

### 传统风俗
<blockquote>

Traditional customs are still important during weddings and religious festivals. People wear traditional costumes and eat special foods.

It is important to maintain our different cultural identities. We should celebrate festivals, teach traditional skills and protect historic places.

The older generations tend to have very traditional ideas about how people should live, think and behave. However, some people believe that these ideas are not helpful in preparing younger generations for modern life. To what extent do you agree or disagree withthis view?

<blockquote>

it is true that many older people believe in traditional values that often seem incompatible with the needs of younger people. While I agree that some traditional ideas are outdated, I believe that others are still relevant and should not be forgotten.

On the one hand, many of the ideas that elderly people have about life are becoming less relevant for younger people. In the past, for example, people were advised to learna profession and find a secure job for life, but today's workers expect much more variety and diversity from their careers. At the same time, the 'rules' around relationships are being eroded as young adults make their own choices about who and when to marry. But perhaps the greatest disparity between the generations can be seen in their attitudes towards gender roles. The traditional roles of men and women, as breadwinners and housewives, are no longer accepted as necessary or appropriate by most younger people.

On the other hand, some traditional views and values are certainly applicable to the modern world. For example, older generations attach great importance to working hard, doing one's best, and taking pride in one's work, and these behaviours can surely benefit young people as they enter today's competitive job market. Other characteristics that are perhaps seen as traditional are politeness and good manners. In our globalized world, young adults can expect to come into contact with people from a huge variety of backgrounds, and it is more important than ever to treat others with respect. Finally, I believe that young people would lead happier lives if they had a more "old-fashioned" sense ofcommunity and neighborliness.

In conclusion, although the views of older people may sonmetimes seem unhelpful in today's world, we should not dismiss all traditional ideas as irrelevant.
